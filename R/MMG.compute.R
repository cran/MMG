# NOTES:	* One tricky thing is the fact that the numbering
#		in the data file is 1 .. N, whereas here it is the
#		C convention, which is used 0 .. N-1.  Macros could
#		have been devised READ_FROM_R() and PRINT_TO_R().
#		As for now, the instances where such manipulations are
#		needed are flagged with 'C-numbering'.
#
#		Basically, as soon as possible everything is done
#		using the C convention.  Turning back to the R
#		convention is done only at the last minute at the time
#		of outputting something.
#
#		* Also, the matrices are flattened by R but in a
#              surprising way.  {{a, b}, {c, d}} becomes {a, c, b, d}.
#
#		* It is to be noted as well that the adjacency lists
#              describe incoming edges.  The neighbours of i
#              influence i!  And not: The neighbours of i are
#              influenced by i.  This is because the class of i is
#              influenced by its neighbours and not the opposite.

# FUNCTION: MMG.read.file(FILE-NAME)
#
#	This function reads the file FILE-NAME, which is supposed to
#	contain the data describing the adjacency list of the metabolic
#	network alongside the MS quantifications.  (NA should be used
#	for non-quantified proteins.)
#
#	The format of the file is:
#
#	    INDEX VALUE NEIGHBOUR1 W1 NEIGHBOUR2 W2 . . . NEIGHBOURn Wn
#
#	where:
#
#	    INDEX: is the index of the node
#	    VALUE: is a real value or NA (MS measurement)
#	    NEIGHBOURi: the indices of the neighbours (connected through a
#	                compound of weight Wi)
#
#	The value returned is a list of vectors representing the
#	adjacency matrix alongside the MS quantifications.  After
#
#	    dat <- MMG.read.file(FILE)
#
#	is a list with the following entries: adjacency.matrix, lengths, and
#	n.nodes.  Therefore:
#
#	    dat$adj[k, 2]: the MS quantification
#	    dat$adj[k, 2 i + 1]: the i-th neighbour
#	    dat$adj[k, 2 i + 2]: the i-th weight
#
#	    dat$len[k]: length of dat$adj[k]
#
#	    dat$n: number of nodes
#
#	Example:
#
#	    dat <- MMG.read.file("test.dat")

# FUNCTION: MMG.compute(FILE-NAME, SIGMA, ALPHA, BURN-IN, STEPS)
#
#	Performs a Gibbs sampling based on the data obtained from
#	FILE-NAME and the model described in Sanguinetti & al,
#	Bioinfomatics 2008.  The following parameters can be set:
#
#	* SIGMA: Standard deviation of the unchanged distribution;
#
#	* ALPHA: Interplay between Standard Mixture Model and
#	Mixture Model on Graphs.  If ALPHA small, only the graph
#	structure counts, and if ALPHA -> +âˆž, one tends towards a
#	pure Mixture Model.
#
#	* BURN-IN and STEPS are the number of steps performed
#	by the Gibbs sampler.
#
# RETURNS: a list with the following fields,
#
#	* LUP
#	* LDOWN
#	* DATA
